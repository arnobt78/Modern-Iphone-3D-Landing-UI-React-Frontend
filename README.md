## Components & Reusability

Each component is modular and can be reused in other React projects:

- **Navbar**: Responsive navigation bar with Apple branding and links.
- **Hero**: Main product showcase with video and CTA.
- **Highlights**: Section with animated video carousel and highlight texts.
- **Model**: Interactive 3D iPhone model with color/size selection.
- **Features**: Storytelling section with images, video, and animated text.
- **HowItWorks**: Explains the A17 Pro chip with visuals and video.
- **Footer**: Informational footer with links and copyright.

To reuse a component, import it in your React project and provide necessary props (see each file for details). For example:

```jsx
import Model from './components/Model';

<Model />
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd iphone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or as shown in terminal)

---

## Deployment

This project is ready for Netlify deployment. The `netlify.toml` file ensures SPA routing works smoothly.

1. **Build the project:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder in Netlify dashboard, or connect your GitHub repo.
   - All routes will redirect to `index.html` for client-side navigation.

## Usage & Walkthrough

### Main Flow

1. **Navbar**: Top navigation with Apple logo, search, and bag icons.
2. **Hero Section**: Displays iPhone 15 Pro with responsive video and CTA button.
3. **Highlights**: Animated carousel of product highlight videos and texts.
4. **Model**: Interactive 3D iPhone model. Users can select color and size.
5. **Features**: Story-driven section with images and video.
6. **How It Works**: Details about the A17 Pro chip with visuals and video.
7. **Footer**: Informational links and copyright.

### Animations

- GSAP powers scroll and timeline animations for smooth transitions.
- Video carousel uses GSAP for progress indicators and transitions.

### 3D Model

- Uses Three.js via @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei.
- Model is loaded from `/public/models/scene.glb`.
- Color and size selection updates the model in real-time.

### Error Monitoring

- Sentry is integrated for error tracking and performance monitoring.
